# Juliusz-Cydzik-Thesis-
Here I will add various scripts associated with my masters thesis titled "Preparing Non-Human Primates to Study Hand-Eye Coordination in Frontal Eye Fields (FEF) of 
Non-Human Primates During Delayed Movement Task", which I will be completing in  May of 2023. 
-The first script compare_ang.m can be used along with the sfile.txt
-The sfile.txt is a file containing: 
"trial" "stack" "class" "duration" "H_amp" "V_amp" "H_vel" "V_vel" "EyeRT" "ArmRT" "arm_duration" "ArmRT2" "button1" "button2" "delay" "sac ang" "targR" "targL"
-In our lab we use behavioral tasks refered to as stacks.
-In my project I am using 8 target locations which the animal makes eye and arm movements to refered to as classes. 
Thesis work in progress!Will provide more description shortly:)
