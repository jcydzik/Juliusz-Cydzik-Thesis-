# Juliusz-Cydzik-Thesis-
Here are various scripts associated with my thesis. 

1)-The first script compare_ang.m can be used along with the sfile.txt


-The sfile.txt is a file containing: 
"trial" "stack" "class" "duration" "H_amp" "V_amp" "H_vel" "V_vel" "EyeRT" "ArmRT" "arm_duration" "ArmRT2" "button1" "button2" "delay" "sac ang" "targR" "targL"


-In our lab we use behavioral tasks referred to as stacks 

-In my project I am using 8 target locations which the subject makes eye and arm movements to refered to as classes  

-2) The other matlab script allfigs.m is used to plot accuracy and delay periods over time

-Subjects perform the tasks after a given delay period

-As delay period changes accuracy is reviewed 

-3) wilcoxJCpub.m is an analysis script used with :
 
18monthtable.txt
Rewardtable.txt
flashtable.txt
flashperiodtable.txt


horizontal_bar_final.m is a script used to generate horizontal bar plots. 

Enjoy!
